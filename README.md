#   Health Care Internet:
Exploring the Construction of Use- Inspired Communication Eco-System for Patient-Centered Care.
##  Problem Statement:
-   Drug safety information dissemination:
After a drug has been approved by FDA, hitherto unknown drug interactions can come to light from its widespread usage.  In that case, the pharmacies, doctors and patients must know the details immediately.

-   Continuity of Care: 
To ensure quick and effective healthcare for a patient, continuity of care must be maintained. A patient has to carry all his medical records to the referred doctor to get a correct diagnosis. This is not only cumbersome and time delaying, but is also error prone. 

-   Patient to patient communication: 
For effective patient engagement, and a means to avoid errors, improve quality, save money and achieve better health outcomes. A patient centered communication is required.

##  Solution:
-   My implementation will try to provide a conduit through which feedback could be sent from patients and doctors to drug companies/FDA and similarly for REMS to be propagated to doctors/patients/pharmacies so that healthcare for a given patient can be altered if necessary.

-   Also, by making a patientâ€™s electronic health records available over the internet to all the doctors and medical providers authorized will ensure continuity of care, along with quick delivery of healthcare.

-   Patient to patient communication is implemented in this project as a discussion forum for every disease where patients can share their view, ideas, ask other patients and comment on the replies just like a social network.
